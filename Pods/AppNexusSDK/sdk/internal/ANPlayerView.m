**  To play the visual component of an asset, you need a view 
**  containing an AVPlayerLayer layer to which the output of an 
**  AVPlayer object can be directed. You can create a simple 
**  subclass of UIView to accommodate this. Use the view’s Core 
**  Animation layer (see the 'layer' property) for rendering.  
**  This class, ANPlayerView, is a subclass of UIView  
**  that is used for this purpose.
